    <h1>Alberto Wilkes</h1>
    <div id="introduction">
      <h2>About us:</h2>
      <p> My name is Laura, I am a 21 years old student from <em> Breda University of Apllied Sciences </em> . I love working with Adobe for educating purposes and to entertain myself. Whereas most students moved closer to Breda for their study, I kept living with my parents in Amersfoort. Here I have my friends, my family and my boyfriend. The most important reason to stay in Amersfoort, is because that is where my <strong>very talented</strong> cat lives, his name is Alberto.<br /><br />
         If I don't make it in the film-business, I know my cat will. He does many tricks for you, all he wants back from you in return, is cat-candy.</p>
      <h2>Alberto his specialties</h2>
      <h3>Tricks he does on commando</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stand</li>
        <li>Sit</li>
        <li>Walk</li>
        <li>Talk</li>
		<li>jump</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>Alberto has green eyes, a striped coat and a McDonald's sign on his forehead. he has a long tail that sweeps to both sides when he is happy or triggered. he has white socks on his feet and never learnt how to meow like an adult, since he has learnt he can gain more cat-candy by meowing like a kitten.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="habitat">
      <h2>Habitat</h2>
      <h3>Where to find Alberto</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>On bed with the curtains open, so the sun can shine on his coat;</li>
        <li>On one of the dining chairs;</li>
		<li>On his thrown, named "The scratching pole"</li>
        <li>Under the couch when anybody is coming over and he did not find the time to flee.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>The angry old cat that doesn't want anything to do with Alberto</h3>
      <p>Sadly, Alberto has to share his habitat with a grumpy old cat. Her name is Simone and she had claimed the habitat waaaaay before Alberto did. but due to her age, Alberto is slowly taking over the thrown.</p>
